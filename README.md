The BL4DE website is designed to keep track of created tournaments for the game World of Tanks (worldoftanks.com).

The game World of Tanks hosts a number of tournaments that players can participate in to win in-game goodies 
(mostly their gold currency). Being the leader of a the team I created this to visually display the current and 
upcoming tournaments showing a picture of the map we would play on, the number of players on a team, etc. 
Additionally, the website would have sections dedicated to giving information about the BL4DE clan, including 
a description of their weekly activities as well as some of the history behind the clan.

Note: Currently not activively developing this anymore as I have stopped playing the game. Therefore the only 
reason to continue is for the knowledge I would gain.
