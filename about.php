          <p>
            Even though this clan is fairly new, the players that inhabit it were the same that migrated from
            CB2 to make the original BL4DE. Given that, we have a long-standing history with clan wars and more
            importantly tournaments. BL4DE is mainly a clan that participates in tournaments, but has recently
            shown interest in strongholds.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Mission Statement:</strong> To provide and participate in a competitive environment through tournaments and strongholds.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Our Current Schedule:</strong> We participate in the weekly skirmishes and Stand-To tournaments certain days on the weeks
            we don’t participate in a skirmish (Currently Tuesday, but that changes).
          </p>
          <p>
            We are a small group of players who spend lots of time keeping tournaments organized and staying prepared. In
            order to continue to grow we are looking to recruit players that are willing to participate in tournaments
            regularly. Our prime time is from 7 P.M. - 10 P.M. EST. We’re looking for players with approximately 2000/2500+
            WN8 overall and recent.
